# CS 301 Project Team 1

By: James Podeszfinski, Avinash Kumar, Jincheol (Mike) Jeong

This is the CS 301 project for Team 1. As a part of this project, we have learned the LIME method, applied this method to classifiers, and analyzed our findings. By the end of the project, we feel confident in our understanding of how LIME works and its applications to the real world. In this GitHub repo, we have attached our deliverables for parts 1-4 of the project, as well as the training and testing data we used to better understand what was happening under the hood. The following is a quick overview of where each of our deliverables are located in this repo.

## Training and Testing Data

The data we leveraged was the books dataset from the multi_polarity sentiment dataset (https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/datasets/sentiment/) for part 2 and the TubeSpam dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/YouTube+Spam+Collection) for parts 3 & 4. Both of these datasets can be found under their respective folder directories in this repo.

## Notebooks

Our notebooks for parts 2, 3, and 4 (where we applied the LIME method to classifiers being trained/tested on the two datasets) are located in the "notebooks" folder of this repo. Both of these notebooks are saved as .ipynb, and Google Colab was used to both create and run the notebooks. 

## Papers

Our writeups (papers) for parts 1 and 4 are saved as PDF files and located in the "Papers" folder.

## Thoughts 

Overall, we had a blast working on this project and were excited to learn how to understand what a classifier to actually doing. At the end of it, we are happy to say that we can, with some level of confidence, as answer the age-old question of any classifier: "Why should I trust you?"
